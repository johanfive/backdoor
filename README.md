# Backdoor ðŸšª

`Cheat codes` for your apps.

With 1 input, control a `promise`'s *pending time*, whether it *resolves* or *rejects*, and the data it returns.

Implementing this yourself on the fly is not hard work, but it can get messy and time consuming.
`Backdoor` offers a plug-and-play approach that preserves the readability of your code.

It's especially convenient for working on functions that are lower in the promise chain.

```js
const backdoor = require('backdoorthen');

const backdooredPromise = backdoor({
  actualThenable, // a function returning a Promise
  input, // the variable influencing the outcome
  resolvedValue, // mocked data returned on success
  rejectedValue, // mocked data returned on error
  config // object to override the defaults
});

backdooredPromise().then().catch();
```

## params

`actualThenable` | `input` | `resolvedValue` | `rejectedValue` | `config`

```
Name            Required  Type      Notes
_____________________________________________________
actualThenable  true      function  returns a promise
input           true      *
resolvedValue   false     *
rejectedValue   false     *
config          false     object
```

<details>
  <summary>actualThenable</summary>

  `actualThenable` required

  A function that returns a promise.
  This is any function in a promise chain that you wish to control.
  ```js
  const doAsyncThing = () => Promise.resolve({ some: 'data' });
  // or
  const createUser = (formData) => axios.post('/users', formData);
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>input</summary>

  `input` required

  This is the variable backdoor evaluates to decide the outcome.

  By default a string is expected, and only the following values are recognized as meaningful triggers:
  ```
  INPUT                    PROMISE
  ___________________________________________
  "backdoor"            -> resolves slow (5s)
  "backdoor-fast"       -> resolves fast (1s)
  "backdoor-error"      -> rejects slow  (5s)
  "backdoor-error-fast" -> rejects fast  (1s)
  ```
  If your use case needs to rely on different values or different types entirely,
  you must configure an  `assessor` in `config`.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>resolvedValue</summary>

  `resolvedValue`
  This is anything you want the mocked promise to return when it resolves (settles with success).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>rejectedValue</summary>

  `rejectedValue`
  This is anything you want the mocked promise to return when it rejects (settles with error).
</details>

## config

```js
const backdoor = require('backdoorthen');

const backdooredPromise = backdoor({
  // ...params,
  config: { // optional
    fast, // delay in ms before the mocked promise settles
    slow, // delay in ms before the mocked promise settles
    separator, // string character separating keywords in the input (eg: "-" in "backdoor-fast")
    assessor, // function assessing the input to determine whether real or mocked data should be returned
    enabledInProd // boolean driving whether backdoor should continue to work in production (false by default)
  }
});

backdooredPromise().then().catch();
```

`fast` | `slow` | `separator` | `assessor` | `enabledInProd` (non-boolean values ignored)

```
Name           Required  Type      Default  Notes
___________________________________________________________
fast           false     integer   1000     ms
slow           false     integer   5000     ms
separator      false     string    -
assessor       false     function
enabledInProd  false     boolean   false    must be boolean
```

<details>
  <summary>fast</summary>

  `fast` default: 1000

  Delay in ms before the mocked promise settles (0 is recognized)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>slow</summary>

  `slow` default: 5000

  Delay in ms before the mocked promise settles (0 is recognized)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>separator</summary>

  `separator` default: "-"

  String character separating the keywords `backdoor` looks for.

  Eg: When the input is "backdoor-error-fast",
  by default backdoor recognizes the "backdoor", "error" and "fast" keywords
  because they're separated by a "-" character.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>assessor</summary>

  `assessor`
  If your use-case does not rely on strings or if you'd rather implement your own logic,
  you can define an `assessor` function that must have the following signature:
  ```js
  const assessor = input => ({
    isBackdoor: boolean,
    doResolve: boolean,
    isFast: boolean
  });
  ```
  which you would then pass as a property of the config object:
  ```js
  const backdooredProm = backdoor({
    // ...omitted for brevity,
    config: { assessor: yourTailoredAssessor }
  });
  backdooredProm().then(...);
  ```
  Example:
  ```js
  const assessor = digit => ({
    isBackdoor: digit < 5,
    doResolve: digit <= 2,
    isFast: digit === 2 || digit === 4
  });
  ```
`isBackdoor`
+ **true**:  skip the actual promise and return mocked data
+ **false**: return the actual promise

`doResolve`
+ **true**:  the mocked promise will resolve with the mocked response
+ **false**: the mocked promise will reject with the mocked error

`isFast`
+ **true**:  wait 1000ms by default (override with config.fast)
+ **false**: wait 5000ms by default (override with config.slow)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>enabledInProd</summary>

  `enabledInProd` default: `false`

  When set to `true`, backdoor will continue to work in a `production` environment.

  When `false` and in a `production` environment,
  the actual thenable is always executed regardless of the input value.
  
  Only the boolean `true` is valid. Anything else is interpreted as `false`.
</details>

## Installation
```sh
npm i -D backdoorthen
# yes, the name "backdoor" was already taken...
```
## Usage
```js
const backdoor = require('backdoorthen');
```
or
```js
import backdoor from 'backdoorthen';
```
## Default behaviour
Although flexible, `backdoor` is built with `string` inputs in mind.
```
INPUT                    PROMISE
___________________________________________
"backdoor"            -> resolves slow (5s)
"backdoor-fast"       -> resolves fast (1s)
"backdoor-error"      -> rejects slow  (5s)
"backdoor-error-fast" -> rejects fast  (1s)
```

## Recommended use
Create a `withBackdoor` function that takes the original thenable as its argument:
```js
const withBackdoor = thenable => backdoor({
  actualThenable: thenable,
  input: formData.firstName,
  resolvedValue: { userName: 'bobLoblaw' },
  rejectedValue: { error: 'kaboom' }
});
```
This allows you to do:
```js
withBackdoor(createUser)(formData)
  .then(doMoreAsyncThings)
  .catch(handleError);
```
which is *so close* to what your code would look like if you hadn't backdoored your promise.

That makes it very easy to remove backdoor once you're ready for your final commit:
```js
createUser(formData)
  .then(doMoreAsyncThings)
  .catch(handleError);
```

`(!)` Note:
+ For readability's sake this readme sometimes uses the words `promise` and `thenable` interchangeably.
+ For accuracy's sake: this readme uses "promise" as a shortcut for `function that returns a promise`.
